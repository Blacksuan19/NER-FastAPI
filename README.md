# Named Entity Recognition using a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

## Model

- Dataset is provided by [kaggle](https://kutt.it/udr2g1)
- model build using Keras Deep learning API, implemented in [this kaggle notebook](https://kutt.it/bW4pgW)

## Usage

```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/classify/Ali%20is%20swimming"
```

- response

```json
{
  "Ali": "I-Person",
  "is": "O",
  "swimming": "O"
}
```

- The API is hosted on a heroku instance for easier access
- The API is implemented using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) providing out-of-box documentation, checkout
  autogenerated docs in [heroku](https://frozen-coast-03690.herokuapp.com/docs)

## Local Development

- Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- start the development server with hot-reloading `uvicorn main:app --reload`
